When getting ready to do an exercise, I can quickly see details for the last time I did the exercise.

roscoe is brought out of a trance state by his phone ringing. he looks down and sees it’s from his soon-to-be wife. it’s tax season and he’s juggling night-school, work, and wedding planning. work has kept him stressed for sure, he spent the day auditing his company’s finances. the _boss_ just told him he better get his share of the chores done tonight. he looks up, “shit, i’ma be late”, it’s 5:34! he intended to get to the gym by 6, so he could be home by 9. with houston traffic, he’d be lucky to make it by 6 even he teleported himself to his car.
he rushes into the gym at 6:08. not bad! after hurridly changing  he heads over to the bench. it’s international chest day. “FFFFFFF***!” (if you know you know 🤣) he forgot what he did last week. but not to worry! he remembers that app he’s been using for the past few days. he opens the app and it immediately pops up with ~a gif of terry crews flipping his pecs~ the days workout. the app knows it’s monday and it has the two pieces of info he needs in his life: what he did last time he did this exercise and an overview of what he has to do today. he’s supposed to increase his weight to 85% of his 3rm. he loads up 285 and does his first set. invigorated by the app saving the day, opens it up to log his set. he’s delited by the simplicity of it. the app just asked if he was able to complete the set: he selected yes.
