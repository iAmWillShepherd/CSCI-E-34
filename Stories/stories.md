> Charlie can quickly see the details of the last time he did a particular exercise

Charlie is brought out of a trance state by his phone ringing. He looks down and sees it’s from his soon-to-be wife. It’s tax season, and he’s juggling night-school, work, and wedding planning. Work has kept him stressed for sure, he spent the day auditing his company’s finances. The _boss_ just told him he better get his share of the chores done tonight. He looks up, “shit, I ’ma be late,” it’s 5:34! He intended to get to the gym by 6:00 so he could be home by 9:00. With Houston traffic, he’d be lucky to make it by 6 even he teleported himself to his car.

He rushes into the gym at 6:08. not bad! After hurriedly changing, he heads over to the bench. It’s International Chest Day. “FFFFFFF***!” (if you know you know 🤣) He forgot what he did last week. But no worries! He remembers that app he’s been using for the past few days. He opens the app, and it immediately pops up with ~a gif of terry crews flipping his pecs~ the day's workout. The app knows it’s Monday and it has the two pieces of info he needs in his life: what he did last time he did this exercise and an overview of what he has to do today. He’s supposed to increase his weight to 85% of his 3rm. He loads up 285lbs and does his first set. Invigorated by the app saving the day, he opens it up to log his set. He’s delighted by the sheer simplicity of it. The app just asked if he was able to complete the set: he selected yes.



> Charlie can easily log his workout progress

Charlie is headed to the Apple store to have their geniuses migrate data from his 2015 MacBookPro onto his new 2018 MacBookPro that cost more than some people’s income. He’d typically do stuff like this on his own, but lately, Apple has been making it too complicated with their dongles. He feels his wrist buzz. _Reminder: GYM_. “Oh yeah, I need to get a case!”. He grabs a case for his new iPhone so he can track his workout without damaging it.

As he’s warming up on the Stair Master™, he’s checking out what today’s workout entails. HIT and agility work. His wrist pulses again, _Goal reached!_ Time to head out to the turf. After opening the app, he quickly taps the option to start the workout and waits for the stopwatch to signify the start of the workout. After his first interval. He opens the app. _Did you complete the interval?_ Today was tough; he has to be honest with himself and say no. Now he gets to input how much of it he completed quickly. His wrist buzzes. _30 seconds to next interval..._ He puts his phone down and get’s ready for the next round.



> Nola can quickly start the day's workout

Nola looks around the room at her teammates doing epic fist pumps after successfully shipping a significant redesign of her company’s most popular product. She’s had a hell of a day. Her team is full of cowboys. They often wait until the last possible minute to get Q.A. involved. She’s spent the past 3 days doing manual testing for the new features they are shipping. No one thought to bring her into the process sooner, so she could have drafted test plans and automated the new tests. Oh well, it’s done now. Stressed out, she tells her team she’s dipping out. The gym is beckoning.

She walks in the gym and gets changed into the proper gym attire. It’s leg day, so she heads to the turf to do some active stretching and mobility work. Her pre-workout is kicking in, and she’s ready to hit the rack. She pulls out her phone so she can see what weight she’s working with today. After opening the app, she grins. The app knew it was her leg day and presented her with the option to start the day's workout. She came to the gym to reduce stress, not add to it by having to tap a bunch of times just to start her workout. Pumped by the caffeine and respite from work, she gears up and bangs out a solid warm-up set of 12. she pulls out her phone and sees an option to add her completed set as a warm-up. She loves data and is hoping to see if her hypothesis about warm-up sets is correct, so she’s been logging all her warm-up sets. So far she’s been pleased with how flexible it’s been. She often warms-up until she’s feeling good enough to get into her working sets.


> Nola can quickly see how to load the bar

Nola is starting to get up there in weight on her deadlifts. She looks down at her phone and sighs. 78KG!. She’s already tired and is not in the mood to be doing weight-room math. She’s used to working in kilograms, but this gym seems to only have 25KG plates and all other plates are in pounds. 

She almost gets to the point of being irked when she remembers seeing this things that tells her what plates to put on the bar given a weight. She quickly goes to the weight loader and enters the weight for her set. Viola! She follows the guidance given by the app and moves on in life.
