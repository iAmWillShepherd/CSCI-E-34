# User interview

These interviews are a compilation of my raw notes, the transcriptions of some of the stuff my interviewees said, and my summary of what was said. These are purposefully raw because I felt more effort should be put into summarizing the ~paint points~ opportunities they seemed more passionate about. I kept my followed up questions grouped with the questions that spurred them to make things a bit clearer.

## Reuben

I was unable to interview the people I intended to since I was out of town last week, so interviewed my workout partner, Reuben, since we were both in Jacksonville, FL this past weekend (for context, we both live in Houston, TX).

### Q0

- Do you have a workout routine?

> Yes

- Do you create your own routines?

> No

His answers align most closely with my _Athlete_/_Client_ personas.

### Q1

- How do you keep track of progress against your workout routine?

> I don't

- What is the primary reason you don't keep track of your progress?

> It’s time-consuming and a bit of a pain during a workout.

- How would you prefer to track your workout progress?

> I don't want to have to think about it

- Could you elaborate? What precisely would you like to avoid thinking about?

> I want to avoid remembering to write out everything I did during my workout. If my progress were tracked more automatically or maybe via voice logs, I would be more inclined to do it.

- If you started tracking your progress today, what are the primary insights you would like to gain after 3 months of tracking?

> Changes in body weight, body fat %, rep abilities, workout weight increases, maybe a correlation between sleep and workout success.

### Q2

- What are the most difficult parts following your workout routine?

> Remembering where I left off, like which exercises I did the day before or the amount of weight I used the last time I did a specific exercise. I have this issues literally every workout.

- How does it make you feel when you don't remember what you did the previous workout?

> It’s annoying but since I’m not really competing for something, it's not that big of a deal.

### Q3

- Do you have a workout partner, personal trainer, or coach?

> Yes, I have a workout partner, and I used to have coaches when I played football.

- Does your partner, personal trainer, or coach track you progress?

> No. I have a workout partner, but we don’t track our progress.

### Q4

- What devices would you use to track progress against your workout routines (paper, phone, smartwatch, tablet, a personal computer)?

> I will not use pen and paper, but I’d use a phone or a smartwatch while I'm at the gym. I’d use my laptop too, but only for reviewing my progress.

- What devices would you use to create your own workout routines?

> A smartwatch or phone app. I wish there were an app that walked you through a workout handsfree like a GPS directs you places.

### Q5

- Have you ever used a workout tracking application before?

> Yes I have

- Do you still use the app (why or why not)?

> No it wasn’t as user-friendly as I liked and hated having to get on my phone so often during a workout.

### Q6

- Do you share your workout routines?

> Yes

- How do you currently share your routines?

> via text or verbally.

## Kenneth

This is a supplemental interview I did to gain some more insight.

### Q0

- Do you have a workout routine?

> not really, but I kinda have my set of exercises I will do

- Do you create your own routines?

> No

His answers align most closely with my _Athlete_/_Client_ personas.

### Q1

- Do you create your own routines?

Not really, but he knows he's going to do some of the main exercises. Does about 10 different workouts, and won't do new stuff unless he's with someone. Doesn't really keep track of weights, but does whatever he feels good about. Mostly based off what he knows how to do.

- How do you keep track of progress against your workout routine?

Doesn't really track workout progress but does keep track of what exercises he did the last workout.

- Any reasons why you don't keep track of progress?

Too many things out there. A win for him is just getting into the gym. Also said he doesn't go with anyone and doesn't really know what to do

- What goals do you have in mind when training in the gym?

Set a goal to gain weight, doesn't really push himself

### Q2

- What are the most difficult parts following your workout routine?

Doesn't really have a set schedule to go to the gym.  Availability of equipment. The hard part is logging the progress, doesn't want to do it

> would be cool if the app had workouts that fit in a limit or tailor the workout experience based on goals and use the results of others to help me with mine. basically wants the exercises that will have the highest impact

### Q3

- Do you have a workout partner, personal trainer, or coach?

> No

### Q4

- What devices would you use to track progress against your workout routines (paper, phone, smartwatch, tablet, a personal computer)?

Only wants to use a phone. Would use a pc to review especially if there were some cool charts.

### Q5

- Have you ever used a workout tracking application before?

> Yes

- Why did you stop using it?

Doesn't see any value coming back. Only wants to see what he needs to do for the day. They are hard to learn and very specific to things like running or biking or yoga.

### Q6

- Do you share your workout routines?

> No

> Would be cool to have pictures for progress being made. maybe monthly so I can see visible changes over time

# Stories

1. Reuben quickly sees the details for the last time he did that exercise.
2. Reuben is in the middle of his workout and can easily log his progress.
3. Kenneth pulls out his phone to start a workout and doesn't have to click through a bunch of options to start that day's workout.

# Long stories

I decided to use pet names in the stories so I could have one of my stories feature a female character.

> Reuben quickly sees the details for the last time he did that exercise.

Charlie is brought out of a trance state by his phone ringing. He looks down and sees it’s from his soon-to-be wife. It’s tax season, and he’s juggling night-school, work, and wedding planning. Work has kept him stressed for sure, he spent the day auditing his company’s finances. The _boss_ just told him he better get his share of the chores done tonight. He looks up, “shit, I ’ma be late,” it’s 5:34! He intended to get to the gym by 6:00 so he could be home by 9:00. With Houston traffic, he’d be lucky to make it by 6 even he teleported himself to his car.

He rushes into the gym at 6:08. not bad! After hurriedly changing, he heads over to the bench. It’s International Chest Day. “FFFFFFF***!” (if you know you know 🤣) He forgot what he did last week. But no worries! He remembers that app he’s been using for the past few days. He opens the app, and it immediately pops up with ~a gif of terry crews flipping his pecs~ the day's workout. The app knows it’s Monday and it has the two pieces of info he needs in his life: what he did last time he did this exercise and an overview of what he has to do today. He’s supposed to increase his weight to 85% of his 3rm. He loads up 285lbs and does his first set. Invigorated by the app saving the day, he opens it up to log his set. He’s delighted by the sheer simplicity of it. The app just asked if he was able to complete the set: he selected yes.

Nola looks around the room at her teammates doing epic fist pumps after successfully shipping a significant redesign of her company’s most popular product. She’s had a hell of a day. Her team is full of cowboys. They often wait until the last possible minute to get Q.A. involved. She’s spent the past 3 days doing manual testing for the new features they are shipping. No one thought to bring her into the process sooner, so she could have drafted test plans and automated the new tests. Oh well, it’s done now. Stressed out, she tells her team she’s dipping out. The gym is beckoning.

She walks in the gym and gets changed into the proper gym attire. It’s leg day, so she heads to the turf to do some active stretching and mobility work. Her pre-workout is kicking in, and she’s ready to hit the rack. She pulls out her phone so she can see what weight she’s working with today. After opening the app, she grins. The app knew it was her leg day and presented her with the option to start the day's workout. She came to the gym to reduce stress, not add to it by having to tap a bunch of times just to start her workout. Pumped by the caffeine and respite from work, she gears up and bangs out a solid warm-up set of 12. she pulls out her phone and sees an option to add her completed set as a warm-up. She loves data and is hoping to see if her hypothesis about warm-up sets is correct, so she’s been logging all her warm-up sets. So far she’s been pleased with how flexible it’s been. She often warms-up until she’s feeling good enough to get into her working sets.
