This is a supplemental interview I did to gain some more insight.

### Q0

* Do you have a workout routine?

> not really, but i kinda have my set of exercises i will do

* Do you create your own routines?

> No

His answers align most closely with my _Athlete_/_Client_ personas

### Q1

* Do you create your own routines?

Not really, but he knows he's going to do some of the main exercises. Does about 10 different workouts, and wont do new stuff unless he's with someone. Doesn't really keep track of weights, but does whatever he feels good about. Mostly based off what he knows how to do.

* How do you keep track of progress against your workout routine?

Doesn't really track workout progress but does keep track of what exercises he did the last workout.

* Any reasons why you don't keep track of progress?

too many things out there. a win for him is just getting into gym. Also said he doesn't go with anyone and doesn't really know what to do

* What goals do you have in mind when training in the gym?

Set a goal to gain weight, doesn't really push himself

### Q2

* What are the the most difficult parts following your workout routine?

Doesn't really have a set schedule to go to gym. Availability of equipment. The hard part is logging the progress, doesn't want to do it

> would be cool if the app had workouts that fit in a limit or tailor the workout experience based on goals and use the results oof others to help me with mine. basically wants the exercises that will have the highest impact

### Q3

* Do you have a workout partner, personal trainer, or coach?

> No

### Q4

* What devices would you use to track progress against your workout routines (paper, phone, smart watch, tablet, personal computer)?

Only wants to use phone. would use a pc to review especially if there was some cool charts.

### Q5

* Have you ever used a workout tracking application before?

> Yes

* Why did you stop using it?

Doesn't see any value coming back. Only wants to see what he needs to do for the day. They are hard to learn and very specific to things like running or bicking or yoga

### Q6

* Do you share your workout routines?

> No

> Would be cool to have pictures for progress being made. maybe monthly so I can see visible changes over time
